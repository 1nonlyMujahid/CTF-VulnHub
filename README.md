This is the Repository for my group and I when we completed the CTF challenge for multiple machines present on VulnHub, and successfully patched the vulnerabilities present which were found by scanning the machines using a web scanner.

The VMs that we were successful in completing the Challenge were:
1. **UltimateLAMP:** Successfully secured web server stacks by identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities.
